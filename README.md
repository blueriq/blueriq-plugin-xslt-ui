# About

The plugin `blueriq-plugin-xslt-ui` used to be a part of the Blueriq Runtime but since the release of Blueriq 11, the support of this plugin is discontinued. 
Blueriq released the sources of this plugin with the intention of enabling customers to migrate to a newer frontend at their own pace but without support from Blueriq. No rights reserved.
